==========

We released XL 19.1.0

The fields :attr:`addr2` and :attr:`prefix` are now mostly hidden in forms. We
consider them obsolete.  :mod:`lino_xl.lib.contacts`.


2019-01-21
==========

New plugin attribute :attr:`lino_xl.lib.tim2lino.Plugin.timloader_kwargs` to be
used e.g. as follows::

    def setup_plugins(self):
        self.plugins.tim2lino.configure(
            languages='de fr',
            timloader_kwargs=dict(etat_registered="C"))
        super(Site, self).setup_plugins()

This new feature is not tested because the reason was just a missing "u"
prefix.

The change notes for :ref:`xl` are now spearated from those of :ref:`lino`.
